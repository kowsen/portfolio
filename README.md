# Kyle's Portfolio Website

This is my super simple portfolio site.

My primary goals with this project were to:

- Have a lightweight, responsive portfolio site
- Be able to modify my project list without messing with code

This was previously build using Svelte, but in 2025 I've migrated it to Astro instead, and rebuilt it to be a little snazzier. And now instead of using a ton of Javascript, it now uses no Javascript!
