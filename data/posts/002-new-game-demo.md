## Demo for a new game

*04/16/2021*

Hi all! Been a while since I've posted, both because writing is hard and because I haven't had too much to talk about, but I'm finally far enough into my latest project to share a demo with you all!

The game's tentatively called "Adrift" and it's a unique-ish take on a text adventure for iOS and Android. You can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcX3Gkln4bKQKJI1xCTHpSStv-xvnSzjMDtuuYoqnw98dr6w/viewform) and give feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemdpoSl6NSwWDwXmtksnXfp8Li5FCGp6e-G9cFEtlwE0ipdw/viewform) or just in the comments on this post.

I'll be making some posts later talking about challenges I've run into throughout development and my future plans, but for now I just wanted to check in and share these links. Talk to you all soon!

\- Kyle
