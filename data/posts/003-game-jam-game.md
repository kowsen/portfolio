## I did a Game Jam

*06/21/2021*

Time for my bi-monthly blog post! I made a game for the GMTK 2021 game jam and you can [check it out here](https://kylebyte.itch.io/super-ball-and-chain). As with anything made in 48 hours, there's so much more I want to do with it but I'm still really happy how it turned out.

I'm too lazy to write a full retrospective on the dev process, so I'll just throw some scattered thoughts here:

- Realistic physics aren't always the most fun way to do things. My game didn't work until I added completely broken physics.

- Even though I can't make good art, it would have been a better game if I made all my assets. I pulled stuff from OpenGameArt because I can't draw, but it just ended up making my game feel more generic than it is.

- If your Game Jam game can be exported to web, I highly recommend [posting it to Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/799752). You can get way more eyes on it than if it's just in the jam and it's fun to see people interact with your game.

- I should have gotten more feedback earlier. The game's way too hard but I didn't figure that out until it was too late because only I was playing it.

- Interact with other devs during the Jam. I only starting going on the Discord server for this one after it ended and I regret not chatting earlier.

- Not having to design levels saved me from a lot of stress, I'd recommend designing a game around that to any new Game Jammer.

- I should have slept but I didn't. If I do this again, I'm 100% sure I'll make the same mistake.

Let me know your high score if you give it a try or any questions you have about it / the dev process! Talk to you all later.
