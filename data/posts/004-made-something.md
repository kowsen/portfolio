## I made something silly

*02/11/2022*

Hey, it's been a while. I had high hopes that I'd write on here consistently, but I'm too busy finding new projects to start and never finish to ever maintain something like that.

A lot's changed since June - I'm back in the workforce and game design's back on the backburner. Still though, I found some time to make something silly and I needed to put it somewhere. For some reason when I heard this song, this page popped into my head so clearly that I just had to make it.

If anyone's out there, I hope the last six months have treated you well and that you get something out of this.
