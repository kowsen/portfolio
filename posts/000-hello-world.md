## Hello World!

Alrighty, let's see how many posts we end up writing before this gets abandoned.

Hey anyone who's reading this! I've recently quit my job at Google (well, technically my last day's 2/5, but close enough) and after a short vacation I'm gonna put all my effort into designing and finishing a new game.

This is something I've been excited to do for a long time. Ever since I made [Apocashop](https://static.kylebyte.com/apocashop) in college I've known that making games could make me happy, and last summer I finally took a week off to build another one. The result was [Fortune City](https://static.kylebyte.com/fortune), and while I wasn't able to find the fun with that idea, it helped me remember what I'd been missing at my job and brought me to a realization - even though quitting might not be the smartest thing to do right now, I'd have a hard time living with myself if I didn't give this another try while I can.

I've tried this before. Between my previous job and Google I took a year off to make games that ended up mostly being a year of me watching tv, playing games, and having various existential crises before eventually cobbling together [Maze Frenzy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylebyte.mazegame) so I wouldn't have a year long gap in my resume when I was applying to jobs.

That's easily what this could turn into too, but I really feel like this time's gonna be different.

After getting to work with a bunch of really smart people for a few years, I'm a much better developer than I was then. I'm also generally in a better place in my life, and I can afford to keep this going longer than I could last time.

And hey, if this doesn't work out, I can think of a lot of worse ways to ride out the quarantimes.

So hopefully I'll be back here again soon to continue talking to myself. Love ya!
