## Hello World!

**tl;dr I'm making games again and I'll be posting about my progress here!**

Alrighty, let's see how many posts we end up writing before this gets abandoned.

Hey anyone who's reading this! I've recently quit my job at Google (well, technically my last day's 2/5, but close enough) and after a short vacation I'm gonna put all my effort into designing and finishing a new game.

This is something I've been excited to do for a long time. Ever since I made [Apocashop](https://static.kylebyte.com/apocashop) in college I've known that making games is something I want to do, and last summer I finally took a week off to build another one. The result was [Fortune City](https://static.kylebyte.com/fortune), and while I wasn't able to find the fun with that idea, it helped me realize that even though quitting might not be the smartest thing to do right now, I need to give this another try while I can.

Between my previous job and Google I took a year off to make games that ended up mostly being a year of me watching tv and having various existential crises before eventually cobbling together [Maze Frenzy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylebyte.mazegame) so I wouldn't have a year long gap in my resume when I was applying to jobs.

This could easily turn into a repeat of last time, but after a few years of working with some super smart people I'm a much better developer than I was then and I'm generally in a better place in my life. And hey, if this doesn't work out, I can think of a lot of worse ways to ride out the quarantimes.

I'll try to keep this blog updated with my progress once I get started on development, so hopefully I'll be back here again soon to continue talking to myself. Love ya!
