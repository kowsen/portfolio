title: Super Ball & Chain
tagline: A Top-Down Brawler made in 36 hours
description: A game I made for the 2021 GMTK game jam. After trying a lot of unique and quirky game ideas, this was an attempt to go back to basics and just make a fun game that feels good to play. I'll make an improved version someday.
