title: Adrift
tagline: A time loop text adventure for phones
description: Play me on a touchscreen! If you play with a mouse, you'll need to scroll to use most controls instead of dragging. I keep coming back to this idea, and it's fun to write for, but I don't know how to add enough puzzles to make it a game.
