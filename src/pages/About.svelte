<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<span>Hiya, I'm Kyle!</span>

<h3>No, like, what do you do and stuff?</h3>
<span>Oh yeah, my name's Kyle Owsen and I'm an independent game developer coming off a stint as a frontend developer at Google. While I was there, I worked on the core team for the Google Cloud Console. Before that, I built games like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylebyte.mazegame">Maze Frenzy</a> and <a href="https://apocashop-game-f24cd.web.app">Apocashop</a> that you can find on my home page, and if you want to go even further back I worked on cutting edge education and whiteboarding software at SMART Technologies (as well as maintaining some less than cutting edge legacy codebases)</span>

<h3>What are you up to now?</h3>
<span>I'm taking some time to work on making games again. I've just finished a demo for a webgame called <a href="https://fortune-city-f24cd.web.app">Fortune City</a> and I'm currently playing around with new technologies and new ideas to figure out what I want to do next!</span>

<h3>Oh, so you're unemployed.</h3>
<span>Well you don't have to say it like that.</span>

<h3>I didn't mean anything by it, I just thought maybe you'd lead with th—</h3>
<span>—when I said I was an independent game developer and then linked to a bunch of games you've never heard of you probably should've filled in the blanks.</span>

<h3>Fair enough. Anything fun about you?</h3>
<span>Nothing you wouldn't expect. I'm a huge fan of retro games, Dungeons and Dragons, Star Trek, baseball, and all those other things that people with software engineer portfolio sites and a game dev hobby seem to like.</span>
