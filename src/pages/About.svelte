<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<span>Hiya, I'm Kyle!</span>

<h3>No, like, what do you do and stuff?</h3>
<span
  >Oh yeah, my name's Kyle Owsen and I'm an independent game developer and a
  software developer at a Seattle company called Qumulo. Before that, I was a
  frontend developer at Google who worked on the core team for the Google Cloud
  Console for about two and a half years. If you want to go even further back, I
  built games like <a
    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylebyte.mazegame"
    >Maze Frenzy</a
  >
  and <a href="https://static.kylebyte.com/apocashop">Apocashop</a> that you can
  find on my home page and I worked on cutting edge education and whiteboarding software
  at SMART Technologies (as well as maintaining some less than cutting edge legacy
  codebases)</span
>

<h3>What are you up to now?</h3>
<span
  >I've currently rejoined the adult world and am pretty happy as a developer at
  Qumulo. On the side I'm still pursuing my love of game dev - I had a lot of
  fun building <a href="https://kylebyte.itch.io/super-ball-and-chain"
    >some games for game jams</a
  > and I'm currently playing around with new technologies and new ideas to figure
  out what I want to do next!</span
>

<h3>You're "pretty happy"?</h3>
<span
  >Well yeah, what do you want from me? It's a good job, but a job's still just
  a job.</span
>

<h3>I didn't mean anything by it, I just wanted to—</h3>
<span
  >—pretty good is like a ringing endorsement if you think about it. Usually
  when people ask me how my day was my response is "not too bad," what
  conclusion would you have jumped to for that one?</span
>

<h3>
  Sheesh alright, never mind then. I'm glad you're "pretty happy". Anything else
  fun about you?
</h3>
<span
  >Nothing you wouldn't expect. I love games, tea, baseball, scifi, and all
  those other things that people with software engineer portfolio sites and a
  game dev hobby seem to like.</span
