<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<span>Hiya, I'm Kyle!</span>

<h3>No, like, what do you do and stuff?</h3>
<span
  >Oh yeah, my name's Kyle Owsen and I'm an independent game developer. Before
  that, I was a frontend developer at Google who worked on the core team for the
  Google Cloud Console for about two and a half years and did much of the same
  over at the much cozier companies Qumulo and Kumospace. If you want to go even
  further back, I built games like <a
    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylebyte.mazegame"
    >Maze Frenzy</a
  >
  and <a href="https://static.kylebyte.com/apocashop">Apocashop</a> that you can
  find on my home page and I worked on cutting edge education and whiteboarding software
  at SMART Technologies (as well as maintaining some less than cutting edge legacy
  codebases)</span
>

<h3>What are you up to now?</h3>
<span
  >I'm taking some time between jobs to rest and recuperate, though I've been
  getting a little antsy lately so I'll probably be looking for a new 9-5
  sometime soon. On the side I'm still pursuing my love of game dev - I had a
  lot of fun building
  <a href="https://kylebyte.itch.io/super-ball-and-chain"
    >some games for game jams</a
  > and I'm currently playing around with new technologies and new ideas to figure
  out what I want to do next!</span
>

<h3>So you're going to stick in the adult world next time?</h3>
<span>What's that supposed to mean?</span>

<h3>Nothing nothing, it's just that the last few times you've done thisâ€”</h3>
<span
  >My bad, I've got to get less touchy about stuff. Yeah I've taken some time to
  work on my own projects, but I'm thinking this'll finally be the time I can
  find a balance between holding down a job and working on my own stuff.</span
>

<h3>I guess we'll see. Anything else fun about you?</h3>
<span
  >Nothing you wouldn't expect. I love games, tea, baseball, and all those other
  things that people with software engineer portfolio sites and a game dev hobby
  seem to like.</span
